description = """
 mpmath can be used as an arbitrary-precision substitute for Python's
 float/complex types and math/cmath modules, but also does much more
 advanced mathematics. Almost any calculation can be performed just as
 well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision, with either real or complex
 numbers, and in many cases mpmath implements efficient algorithms that
 scale well for extremely high precision work.
